\usage{
RequireOptions()
}
\description{
These provide top-level, powerful settings for a comprehensive
reproducible workflow. To see defaults, run \code{RequireOptions()}.
See Details below.
}
\details{
Below are options that can be set with \code{options("Require.xxx" = newValue)},
where \code{xxx} is one of the values below, and \code{newValue} is a new value to
give the option. Sometimes these options can be placed in the user's \code{.Rprofile}
file so they persist between sessions.

The following options are likely of interest to most users:
\describe{
  \item{\code{RPackageCache}}{
    Default: \code{NULL}. If a folder is provided, then binary and source packages will
      be cached here. Subsequent downloads of same package will use local copy. Default
      is to have packages not be cached locally so each install of the same version will
      be from the original source, e.g., CRAN, GitHub.
  }
  \item{\code{buildBinarieis}}{
    Default: \code{TRUE}. Only relevant on *nix systems and if
    \code{getOption("Require.RPackageCache")} is set to a  path. If \code{TRUE}, then
       \code{Require} will pass \code{INSTALL_OPTS = "--build"}, meaning the
       package binary will be built and then saved in the
       \code{getOption("Require.RPackageCache")}. This means that subsequent installs
       of this package on this or identical system will be faster.
  }
  \item{\code{persistentPkgEnv}}{
    Default: \code{FALSE}. (ADVANCED USE) \code{Require} stashes a lot of information in a
    hidden environment, located at \code{Require:::.pkgEnv}. This gets reset at each
    restart of R and each reload of Require. To make the stashes more persistent, 
    set this option to \code{TRUE}. A file will be placed at 
    \code{file.path("~", "._Require_pkgEnv.rdata")}, which will be restored at package load
  }
  \item{\code{purge}}{
    Default: \code{FALSE}. If set to (almost) all internal caches used by \code{Require}
    will be deleted and rebuilt. This should not generally be necessary as it will 
    automatically be deleted after (by default) 1 hour (set via 
    \code{R_AVAILABLE_PACKAGES_CACHE_CONTROL_MAX_AGE} environment variable in seconds)
  }
  \item{\code{unloadNamespaces}}{
    Default: \code{TRUE}. (ADVANCED USE) \code{Require} will attempt to detach and unload
    packages that conflict with the requested package installing via \code{Require}.
    This can be complicated, resulting in broken states that can only be recovered
    by restarting R. Default is to attempt to do this. \code{FALSE} will not attempt
    to do this. User must deal with inability to install packages due to package already 
    being loaded.
  }
  \item{\code{verbose}}{
    Default: \code{0}. During a \code{Require}, there is a lot of information collected 
    and used. With \code{verbose} set to \code{1} or \code{2}, more of this information
    will be reported as an attribute attached to the return object of \code{Require}.
    This may help diagnosing problems.
