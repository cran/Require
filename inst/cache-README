This directory was created by the R package 'Require',
available on CRAN [https://cran.r-project.org/package=Require].
It stores cache files used to download and install R packages.
It is safe to delete all or part of these files at any time.
By definition, if cached packages are missing, they are
redownloaded etc. as needed.
